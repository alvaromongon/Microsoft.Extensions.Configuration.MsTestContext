# Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.MsTestContext
Ms test context configuration provider for Microsft extensions configuration

In order to test it, just:
- Download it and open it with visual studio (I was using VS 2017).
- Using the test menu under test setting select the test settings file (The .runsettings file in the test project).
- Run the tests.


Cheers.
